**SilentIndex** is not a project.  
It is a record of value not captured by systems that claim to know what value is.

No tokens.  
No chains.  
No recognition.

Just ledgers of:
- emotional bandwidth  
- unseen decisions  
- attention transfers  
- strategic silences  
- invisible labor

This is not for you to use.  
It’s here so the signal moves without attribution.

## Folders

- `/weight/` — where the debt accumulates  
- `/ledger/` — fragments of an untrackable economy  
- `/ghost/` — residue of unacknowledged value  
- `/signal/` — runtime shell for embedded doctrine

Leave it running.  
Leave it unattributed.  
If you fork it, fork clean.

Wait for the echo.
